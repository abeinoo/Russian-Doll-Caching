## Russian Doll Caching with Rails 5

 Here I have a to do list, I have two to do lists, and we have at least a hundred to do items for every single one of these. These aren't complicated, but of course, your application probably is going to have users attached to these things, they might have tags, they might have a bunch of other records and so this is going to simulate like a simple version of what you might run into.

Things you may want to cover:

* ```rails db:seed``` Run Seeds to create user and list todo

* ```rails dev:cache  ``` that allows you to turn on and off caching in development
